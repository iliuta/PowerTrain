**PowerTrain - FTMS Workout Tracking Application**

PowerTrain is an application that allows you to connect your smartphone to FTMS-compatible fitness equipment via Bluetooth. Developed and tested primarily with a Domyos Woodrower machine, this application may work with other FTMS equipment but without compatibility guarantee.

**üö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è TESTED AND SUPPORTED EQUIPMENT**
‚Ä¢ Domyos Woodrower (tested and functional). Actually, the application recommended by the manufacturer didn't satisfy me, so I developed this application.
‚Ä¢ Other FTMS-compatible rowing machines (no guarantee)
‚Ä¢ Bluetooth LE heart rate sensors
‚Ä¢ Also tested with a connected home trainer bike. If you activate "Developer mode" in the options, you can choose the equipment type.

**üìä AVAILABLE FEATURES**
‚Ä¢ **Real-time data**: Power, cadence, distance, time, calories, heart rate
‚Ä¢ **Structured workouts**: Some sessions are provided by default, but you can add your own, either by duplicating existing sessions or creating new ones.
‚Ä¢ **Resistance control**: In structured workouts, you can set the rowing machine resistance (Example: 50 for resistance 5, 120 for resistance 12, 150 for 15, etc).
‚Ä¢ **Bluetooth connection**: Communication with FTMS equipment, heart rate monitors
‚Ä¢ **Local storage**: Workout session definitions stored locally on your device.
‚Ä¢ **Strava activity export**: Standard FIT format.

** CHARACTERISTICS**
‚Ä¢ **Open Source**: Source code available on GitHub (https://github.com/iliuta/ftms)
‚Ä¢ **Personal project**: Developed by an enthusiast for the community

** COMPATIBILITY AND LIMITATIONS**
PowerTrain has been developed and tested with a Domyos Woodrower. It probably works with other connected rowing machines from Decathlon, but there's no guarantee. You can contribute to the project by testing other equipment and sharing your feedback.

** PRIVACY AND SECURITY**
‚Ä¢ No personal data collection
‚Ä¢ Local storage only or sending to Strava if you connect to it.
‚Ä¢ No tracking

** USAGE**
1. Enable Bluetooth on your device
2. Turn on your FTMS fitness equipment
3. Launch PowerTrain and connect to your device. Set your FTP in the options. Connect to Strava if you want.
4. Select a workout and start rowing!
5. (Optional) The session is sent at the end of the workout to Strava
6. Create your workout session and save it on your device.

**‚òï DEVELOPER SUPPORT**
If PowerTrain helps you in your workouts, you can support the development by buying the developer a coffee via the link in the application.
