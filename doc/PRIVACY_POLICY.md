PowerTrain ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our PowerTrain mobile application (the "App"). This App is designed to connect to Bluetooth fitness equipment and track your workouts.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide Directly
- **Workout Data**: Exercise metrics such as power, cadence, distance, time, heart rate, and calories burned from your fitness equipment

### Information Collected Automatically
- **Bluetooth Data**: Information from connected fitness equipment (rowing machines, bike trainers, heart rate monitors)

### Information from Third Parties
- **Strava Integration**: If you connect your Strava account, we receive profile and activity data as permitted by your Strava authorization. This is needed for uploading your workouts to Strava and it is not even accessed or stored by us.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- **Fitness Tracking**: Display real-time workout metrics from your connected fitness equipment

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- **Workout Data**: Your fitness data is primarily stored locally on your device in industry-standard FIT file format. Once it is sent to Strava, it is stored on Strava's servers and deleted from your device.
- **Secure Storage**: Authentication tokens and user preferences are stored using Android's secure storage mechanisms with encryption.
- **Temporary Data**: Real-time workout data is processed in memory and may be temporarily cached for display purposes

### Data Security Measures
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest
- **Secure Transmission**: All network communications use HTTPS/SSL encryption
